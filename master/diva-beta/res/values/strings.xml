    <string name="dintro">DIVA (Damn insecure and vulnerable App) is an App intentionally designed to be insecure. The aim of the App is to teach developers/QA/security professionals, flaws that are generally present in the Apps due poor or insecure coding practices. If you are reading this you want to either learn App pentesting or secure coding and I sincerely hope that DIVA solves your purpose. So, sit back and enjoy the ride.</string>

    <string name="hardcode_enter">Enter the vendor key</string>

 "<b>Hint</b>: Developers sometimes will hardcode sensitive information for ease.</string>
    <string name="ids1_intro"><b>Objective</b>": Find out where/how the credentials are being stored and the vulnerable code.
 "<b>Hint</b>": Insecure data storage is the result of storing confidential information insecurely on the system i.e. poor encryption, plain text, access control issues etc. "</string>

 "<b>Hint</b>: Improper or no input validation issue arise when the input is not filtered or validated before using it. When developing components that take input from outside, always validate it. For ease of testing there are three users already present in the database, for example one of them is admin, you can try searching for admin to test the output.</string>
